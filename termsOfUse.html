                </p>
                <p>
                    You comply with all applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and anti-trafficking laws.

                <p>
                    You do not abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such behavior), such as through misleading, fraud, identity theft, defamation, bullying, harassment, or stalking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our service-specific additional terms and policies, such as our Prohibited Use of Generative AI Policy, provide more information about appropriate behavior that applies to everyone who uses these Services. If you see others not following these rules, many of our Services allow you to report abuse. When we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in more detail in the What to do if there is a problem section.

                <h2>About these Terms of Use</h2>
                <p>
                    You have certain legal rights that cannot be limited by a contractual arrangement such as these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use are not intended to limit those rights in any way.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    We want these Terms of Use to be easy to understand, so we use examples from our Services. However, not all of the Services mentioned may be available in your country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may update these Terms of Use and any service-specific additional terms from time to time to reflect (1) changes to our Services or our business practices, such as when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory or security reasons, or (3) to prevent misuse or harm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we change these Terms of Use or any service-specific additional terms, we will provide you with at least 15 days' notice before the changes take effect. When we notify you of the changes, we will provide you with the new version of the Terms of Use and will alert you to any material changes. If you do not object before the changes take effect, you will be deemed to have accepted the modified Terms of Use. Our notice will explain this objection process. You can refuse to accept the changes - in this case the changes will not apply to you. However, we reserve the right to terminate our user relationship if the other conditions for termination are met. You can also terminate your user relationship with us at any time by deleting your <a href="nothingFound.html">EyeFind.info Account.</a>

                    The above Terms of Use are fictitious! So they are neither meaningful nor legally binding. The terms and conditions shown are merely intended to illustrate that there COULD be terms and conditions.
